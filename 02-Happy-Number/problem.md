A happy number is a number defined by the following progress: Starting wiht an positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the progress unitl the number equal 1(where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for this progress ends in 1 are happy numbers.

**Example:**
