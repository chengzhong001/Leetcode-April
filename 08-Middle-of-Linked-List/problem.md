# Middle of the Linked List

given a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
if the length of the linked list is even, return the second middle node.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5])
The returned node has value 3.  (The judge's serialization of this node is [3,4,5]).
Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that:
ans.val = 3, ans.next.val = 4, ans.next.next.val = 5, and ans.next.next.next = NULL.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: Node 4 from this list (Serialization: [4,5,6])
Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

**Note:**

- the number of nodes in the given list will be between 1 and 100
